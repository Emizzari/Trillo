# Trillo
Trillo is a project created to practice the use of flex-box 

## Considerations
- check with "caniuse" website and use @support where its necessary

## Challenges
- Display some kind of user menu when hovering over the username in .user-nav
- Display a message menu when hovering over the chat icon in .user-nav (like facebook?)
- Display a box with search suggestions as soon as the user starts typing in the field search
- Create a caption for the .gallery__item with a nice hover effect
- Make the page 100% responsive even for viewport sizes below 500px, maybe even responsive images
